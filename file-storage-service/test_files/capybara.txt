The capybara is a large rodent native to South America and is the largest living rodent. It is closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies, and more distantly related to other rodents such as the chinchilla and nutria. Capybaras live in groups near bodies of water in savannas and dense forests, with group sizes ranging from 10 to 100 individuals. They are hunted for meat, hide, and grease obtained from their fatty skin.
