You are a senior microservices architect.
You need to design a web-application in which people can login, create folders in the interface and upload files into these folders. When selecting a file, the user can select options to summarize the file or generate comprehensive questions on the basis of the file.
These services should all be divided into microservices.

Designing a web application with the described functionalities in a microservices architecture involves breaking down the application into a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is designed around a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Here's a high-level design for the described application:

### 1. User Authentication Service

- **Responsibility**: Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- **Key Technologies**: OAuth2 and JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Endpoints**:
  - Register: Creates a new user account.
  - Login: Authenticates a user and returns a token.
  - Verify: Validates user tokens for accessing protected resources.

### 2. Folder Management Service

- **Responsibility**: Manages folder creation and organization for users.
- **Key Technologies**: Database for storing folder structures (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- **Endpoints**:
  - CreateFolder: Creates a new folder for a user.
  - ListFolders: Lists all folders for a user.
  - DeleteFolder: Deletes a specific folder.

### 3. File Upload and Management Service

- **Responsibility**: Handles file uploads, storage, and retrieval.
- **Key Technologies**: Cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3), database for metadata.
- **Endpoints**:
  - UploadFile: Allows file upload to a specific folder.
  - ListFiles: Lists all files in a folder.
  - DownloadFile: Retrieves a file for download.
  - DeleteFile: Deletes a specific file.

### 4. File Processing Service

- **Responsibility**: Processes files to generate summaries and comprehensive questions.
- **Key Technologies**: NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, GPT-based models for generation tasks).
- **Endpoints**:
  - SummarizeFile: Returns a summary of the file content.
  - GenerateQuestions: Returns a set of questions based on the file content.

### 5. API Gateway

- **Responsibility**: Serves as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
- **Key Technologies**: NGINX, Zuul, or AWS API Gateway.
- **Functionality**: Authentication, request routing, load balancing, and caching.

### System Communication and Data Flow

- **Internal Communication**: Microservices communicate with each other using RESTful APIs or message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.
- **Service Discovery**: Implement a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul, Eureka) for services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other.
- **Security**: Secure all inter-service communications. Implement rate limiting and circuit breakers to prevent system overload.

### Frontend

- **Responsibility**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the application.
- **Key Technologies**: React or Angular for a SPA (Single Page Application), communicating with the backend through the API Gateway.

### Deployment and Scalability

- **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerizing microservices.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing container deployments, scaling, and networking.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) for observing system health and performance.

This architecture allows for the independent scaling of services based on demand (e.g., scaling the File Processing Service during high-demand periods without affecting other services). Additionally, adopting a microservices architecture facilitates continuous deployment and integration practices, enabling rapid iteration and deployment of new features and updates.
